## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
- Messenger:
    - New messages popped up on top
    - Can react and reply to a specific message

- Hypic:
    - Offers users to compare the original picture and the edited one with a simple button
    - Can save the edited picture with the download button easily

- Wechat:
    - Can hide group chats
    - Can mute contacts
    
- Amazon:
    - Can save items not wanted right now for later
    - Has a shopping cart


My app idea:
- For chatting apps like Messenger, I hope there could be ways to group up chats and hide/expand them when I want.
- It can also have quick reponses, such as "I'm caught up right now but I will respond later" which is very convenient in many situations.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I had some trouble connecting the button to the behind logic. I deleted the ViewController by accident, but I did not save it anywhere so I had to build the whole app.
